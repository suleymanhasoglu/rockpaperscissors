## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Used a white background. I also created a scoreboard using HTML and CSS. Then I used a the Math.random() method to get a random number between 0-1 and multiplied by 100. Then I broke up the range into 3 parts. Then I used an If-statement to assign what the computer will choose based on the random number and which range it falls into. Then I used the JavaScript to update the scoreboard and to output a response of what the computer chose and if you won or not.
